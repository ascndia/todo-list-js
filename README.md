//To-Do List Project

This is a simple To-Do list project that was built as a first JavaScript project for learning purposes. The project was built to explore the following concepts:

Local Storage: The project uses Local Storage to save the To-Do list items between sessions, allowing the user to close and re-open the application without losing their progress.
JavaScript Events: The project makes use of various JavaScript events to update the DOM in response to user actions, such as clicking the "Add" button to add a new item to the list.
DOM Manipulation: The project makes use of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, adding and removing elements as needed to update the To-Do list.


//Getting Started

To run the project, simply download the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. The To-Do list should appear, ready for you to add your first item.


//Usage

To add a new item to the To-Do list, simply type your task into the input field and click the "Add" button. The new item will be added to the list, and saved to Local Storage so that it will be available the next time you open the application.

To mark an item as completed, click the checkbox next to the task. This will cross out the task and move it to the bottom of the list.

To remove an item from the list, click the "X" button next to the task. This will permanently remove the task from the list, and update Local Storage accordingly.
